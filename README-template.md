## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

### Screenshot

![](./images/Final%20work%20screenshot.png)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learnt how to group content on a webpage using semantic tags like section, and non semantic tags like "div" coupled with the use of css properties and flexbox to position and style contents on a webpage.Lastly I learnt how to make a webpage responsive.
To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="../css/style.css" type="text/css">
  <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
  <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Lexend+Deca:wght@100..900&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  flex-direction : column;
  flex-direction: row;
  flex: 1;
}

### Continued development

Responsiveness of webpage
Use of flexbox

### Useful resources

- [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com) - This helped me on how to structure a webpage using semantic and non-semantic tags, creating easy access to html elements during the styling process
